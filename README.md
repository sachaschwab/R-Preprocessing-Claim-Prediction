# Preprocessing and analysing raw insurance claim data

## Introduction

This study addresses the topic of whether an investigation using the skills and knowledge acquired in this course suffice to preprocess and analyse an insurance claim dataset, such that it becomes suitable for further building machine learning algorithms to predict whether a travel insurance policy may have a claim during its lifecycle

## Data

Data source is an online published dataset of a third-party travel insurance servicing com- pany based in Singapore, available on Kaggle.
ii. The data appears to be an outflow of an observational study.
iii. There are 63â€™326 observations included in this dataset
iv. The dataset is structured into 11 variables, of which are 3 categorical nominal, 4 categori-
cal binary, 4 numerical continuous variables.
v. No interventions or pre-processing has been undertaken that precede the ones described
below in this report.
vi. Of the 11 variables, 10 are independent variables, 1 (claim status) is the dependent varia-
ble.

## Methods used

- Data cleaning: Identify and eliminate unnecessary records
- Variable transformation and type conversion
- Data representation: Proximity measures
- Exploratory visualisation
